# Chess_Knight
This project aims at finding the shortest possible steps needed to be taken by Knight on the chessboard to reach a given end position from a given start position. This project uses the Breadth-First-Approach(BFA) of DSA. The code is written in the 'C' language. Enter start and end positions of the chess board and the program tells you the minimum step count required for the Knight to start from the start position and reach the end position.
